# MedAgents

This flowchart depicts a system where a patient submits medical imaging data, which is routed through multiple specialized agents. 
Agent A identifies the type of imaging and selects the most appropriate model to analyze it. 
Agent B compiles the analysis results along with the imaging type and model used, then forwards this information to a language model agent. 
Agent C, embodying the role of a medical professional, interprets the results and provides personalized feedback and advice to the patient. 
The overall system streamlines the process from image submission to actionable medical insights.
